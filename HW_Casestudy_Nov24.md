## Industry use of AI and Predictive Technology

Major Banks in Canada are well on their path of Digitalization and AI is proving as a pivotal fintech innovation. AI was originally used by Canadian banks for fraud detection and management. Now it is being used to enhance customer experience providing personalised financial advice to its clients.

Banks are also using AI and machine learning technologies to strengthen their cybersecurity, prevent financial crimes and enhance their risk management. They also deploy these technologies to assist in their back end operations as well.

Scotiabank (Bank of Nova Scotia) [TSE: BNS](https://g.co/kgs/BjkwB1) leveraged it data and analytics technology to engage with financially vulnarable clients during the pandemic. 

ATB Financial, owned by Alberta Provincial government, uses AI to improve their customer experience.


## Challenges of using AI in banking industry

### Investment

Though AI technology is being used in the banking sector in Canada, it is not widespread across the board. Only the top 5% of the banks are using it to add value to their clients. Canada, once a global leader in AI, should invest in AI research, nurturing and retaining talent here. 

### Ethics

The ethical use of AI in customer data is still mired with confusion in Canada withing the highly regulated Banking Sector. Current regulations governing the use of AI in the financial industry is a patchwork of laws or regulations. The federal government and the provincial governments need to step up and address this current situtation.

Eliminating bias, providing transparency and fairness on decisions needs to be addressed.

### Identify vulnerable customers

Banks AI use to identify financial vulnerable customers could be made legal to protect customers from financial burdens. Using AI, banks could proacively talk to clients to keep their credit scores at a good rating.

## Recommendations

Building Trust: Since it is emergencing techology, it is important for financial institutions to thoroughly stress test the technology and introduce AI chat bots who can actually find answers to build the trust in these new tech with its customers.

Expand use of personlised insights on finance and investments to small business to help them with financial management. This would be of great advantage to the business owners, who do not have the time or skill to manage their finances.

Language and context are important to improve the client experience on the digital platforms the AI are using. 

More banks and financial institutions need to invest in actively improving engagement by staying committed to the cause.
