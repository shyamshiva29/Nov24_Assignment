## Challenges of using AI in banking industry

Investment

Though AI technology is being used in the banking sector in Canada, it is not widespread across the board. Only the top 5% of the banks are using it to add value to their clients. Canada, once a global leader in AI, should invest in AI research, rnurchuring and etaining talent here.


Ethics

The ethical use of AI in customer data is still mired with confusion in Canada withing the highly regulated Banking Sector. Current regulations governing the use of AI in the financial industry is a patchwork of laws or regulations. The federal government and the provincial governments need to step up and address this current situtation.

Eliminating bias, providing transpareny and fairness on decisions needs to be addressed.

Identify vulnerable customers

Banks AI use to identify financial vulnerable customers could be made legal to protect customers from financial burdens

## Recommendations

Building Trust: Since it is emergencing techology, it is important for financial institutions to thoroughly stress test the technology and introduce AI chat bots who can actally find answers to build the trust in these new tech with its customers.

Expand use of personlised insights on finance and investments to small business to help them with financial management. This would be of great advantage to the business owners, who do not have the time or skill to manage their finances.

Language and context are important to improve the client experience on the digital platforms the AI are using. 

More banks and financial institions need to invest in actively improving engagement by staying committed to the cause.
